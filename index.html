    <p>
      Made from layer upon layer of flakey pastry, loads of butter, and tasting
      like heaven, the croissant (pronounced “kwa-son”) is simply a thing of joy
      and wonder. Since the 19th-century, croissants have been an important part
      of breakfast in various countries and with different variations in
      fillings and toppings.
